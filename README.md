# iGP-Strategies
Create a showcase of iGP Race. You need to install iGPPlus extension.
How it works:
1. Extract the race results.
2. Click the "Export Q" button. You download the "XXXXXXX_Qualifying.csv" file. Delete "XXXXXX_" from the file name. (it should be "Qualifying.csv")
3. Click on iGPlus button -> Pit Report -> Download. You download the "pit_report.csv" file.
4. Put "Qualifying.csv" and "pit_report.csv" files on the same directory as the main file.
5. Run the "Текстовый документ.py" file.
6. Done :)
